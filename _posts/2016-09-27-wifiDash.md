# [WIFI CAPTIVE PORTAL AND ADMINISTRATOR DASHBOARD](https://abhinavtripathi95.github.io/)

The object of the project was to create a framework for authenticating users for free WiFi and a dashboard for the management of the same.
When you get connected to our WiFi, you will be prompted to type in your mobile number. The system will generate an OTP and send it to you. Enter it in and voil√†!! You're ready to go..
